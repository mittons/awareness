## Introduction

This post is purely informational, devoid of any absolute truths or decision-making directives. It is not a manual of any kind. 
- *I'm not omniscient, my eyes are cloudy.*

While maintaining complete depersonalization of other individuals, this text discusses complex, potentially sensitive topics that *might* be ~**triggering**~ for some in the latter half of the discussion.

By reading this post, you will learn about one possible perspective on three critical aspects of awareness and decision-making. Firstly, you will explore three different levels of informed decision-making. Then, understand four types of issues that can be brought to light. Finally, discover various approaches to handling decision-making on these issues effectively, including necessary cautions against exploitative behaviors.

## Vision - When to Repair the Roof

There is a quote by John F. Kennedy I recently became aware of, and I really like it:
> The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.

While Kennedy used this metaphor to discuss the importance of preparing policies during times of prosperity, I believe it also beautifully illustrates a more immediate, tangible concept:

The problem of informed decision-making, along with its solution.

## The Physical Roof

**Full Sunlight:** The best time to fix a problem on the roof is under the best visibility conditions, when you are as aware as possible of the state of the roof.

**Cloudy Conditions:** If it is cloudy, you might not see every nook and cranny of the problem, and your solution might not be structurally sound. This could lead to a false sense of security, potentially resulting in even worse consequences later on.

**In Darkness:** If it is dark, you might not even see, or know of, the problem at all. How can you work on the roof if you aren't even aware of the state of things?

## The Conceptual Roof

**Full Sunlight:** Shedding proper light on any situation and gaining full awareness is crucial for solving any problem effectively - not just those that physically require daylight. Many challenges can be tackled at any time around the clock, as there is no morality clause that dictates work must only be done during daylight. Observing the situation with patience before acting is essential.

**Cloudy Conditions:** Without shedding enough light on the situation, you might overlook vital parts of it. Implementing solutions that initially appear functional but ultimately have fundamental flaws is a risk. These solutions might not have immediately apparent effects, but can be disastrous to those they inadvertently affect, or when tested over time. Taking action with a cloudy view can lead to unintended consequences and greater costs.

**In Darkness:** Staying in the dark about problems means you cannot deal with them effectively, allowing occurrences to go unnoticed. Without awareness, you won’t even know the extent of the issues you know of—whether there's one instance, ten, a hundred, or thousands on the metaphorical roof.

## Addressing Different States of the Roof

### Addressing Non-Conflict Issues With Solutions 
- When discussing problems and their solutions, I strive for brevity and directness. When possible I prefer stating things in a nonchalant way, avoiding any air of conflict.

### Addressing Conflict-Inducing Issues With Solutions
- Addressing deep-rooted problems often entails temporary discomfort, especially when solutions are focused on unresolved problems and needs, and unsettle established norms. This discomfort is magnified when issues have personal stakes or require navigating interpersonal conflicts.
- **Strategies Personally I Employ:**
    - *Validating Ideas with Trusted Parties:* I discuss potential solutions in confidential settings with trusted individuals to ensure that ideas are sound and actionable before moving forward.
    - *Providing Advance Notice:* I give prior notice before addressing sensitive issues, allowing all parties involved to prepare emotionally. This helps in reducing sudden shock and resistance, facilitating a more receptive environment for discussion.
    - *Preparedness with Solutions:* I strive to develop comprehensive solutions that are ready to be implemented as soon as a problem is acknowledged, ensuring immediate and effective action.
    - *Accountability and Responsibility:* I take full charge of the initiatives I introduce, overseeing them to fruition. I accept and manage responsibility and reasonable accountability, especially when these initiatives cause temporary discomfort, ensuring they are handled with sensitivity.
    - *Ethical and Consensual Actions:* I take care that actions are ethical and consensual, thoughtfully doing my best to avoid any initiatives that could lead to permanent stress/harm for any individuals or groups (me included) without their informed and explicit consent. Ends don't justify the means, I don't do human sacrifice for the greater good or anyones benefit. I don't do collateral damage.
     - *Responsive to Feedback:* When I act, I actively seek advice and input from any observers, and am ready to adjust my strategies based on their feedback to better meet the needs of the situation, while respecting my own expertise during decision-making.
   
### Addressing Unresolved Problems
- **Cautious Disclosure:** I do my best to exercise caution when discussing difficult problems that have not yet been solved, typically only sharing a minor fraction of my awareness. Shedding light on certain issues can sometimes add to the collective distress. Therefore, I only share concerns when I believe the audience is equipped to handle the information emotionally, ensuring that discussions are constructive and do not overwhelm those involved.

### Addressing Perceived Problems
- **Addressing Misperceptions with Care:** Sometimes, the issues I address may not be actual problems but are perceived as such because people are in the dark about them, leading to misconceptions. I try to present these topics with brevity and directness, avoiding conflict. When I anticipate potential discomfort, I introduce the topic minimally and offer immediate solutions to prevent misunderstandings and alleviate any concerns.

## Various Types of Reactions to Roof Repairs

### Impulsive Actions
- **Uninformed Interventions:** Some individuals notice something they perceive as an issue on the roof and impulsively jump into repairs, often in suboptimal conditions like darkness or cloudiness. This can lead to poor outcomes as actions taken without full understanding or proper observation seldom resolve the underlying problems effectively.

### Informed Actions
- **Patient Observation:** There are those who observe patiently, waiting until they fully see the light of the situation and understand the necessary scope, before they start fixing the roof. This approach generally leads to more successful and enduring repairs.

### Interjecting Actions
- **Premature Interjections:** Occasionally, individuals without a full grasp of the situation interject during ongoing repairs. They may rush into action, akin to a novice interrupting a specialist, leading to potentially disastrous consequences. This premature engagement often stems from a lack of awareness and can result in incomplete or harmful solutions.
  - For instance, imagine a caveman witnessing a doctor perform surgery for the first time. If he rushes to aid the patient, misunderstands the situation, and tackles the doctor, the patient could suffer fatal consequences.

### Exploitative Behavior
- **Opportunistic Overreach:** I have witnessed situations where individuals, recognizing a perceived opportunity, hastily push aside the experts to claim credit or derive benefits. This often results in substandard repairs that might pose further risks. Some individuals even turn such behaviour into a career to profit. Opportunistic overreach can range anywhere between uninformed interventions and informed actions.
- **Manipulating the Vulnerable:** Others exploitatively find individuals who, due to lack of experience or vulnerability, are inclined or easily coerced into working on the roof to solve problems or fulfill unmet needs. These exploiters let them do all the work and then take the credit, gaining value or popularity among their friends or peers without providing due recognition or compensation.
- **Undermining the Expert:** There are cases where these exploitative individuals actively work to displace experts they exploit through invalidation, intimidation, or threats, sometimes even "poisoning the well" to advance their own status at the expense of the true professionals. 
I have personally both observed and experienced any behaviour mentioned in these chapters and, as a result, take careful steps to keep my statements, both public and private, depersonalized against others. This approach is a protective measure and also a commitment I uphold to maintain neutrality and objectivity in both my personal and professional environments. Generally, I also always try to depersonalize personal information I discuss in open settings unless I get explicit consent. However, should someone exploit me without my consent, I reserve the right to address the situation directly. Fortunately, for me, I am currently not aware of any such unresolved instances, which allows me to state this without experiencing any personal risk.

### Reactions When Addressing Issues for Resolution

- **Understanding Emotional Climates:** As we have explored various challenges in addressing issues and their potential pathways of resolution, it's crucial to also understand the emotional and psychological reactions that often accompany these efforts. These reactions can cloud our judgment and complicate resolutions. Shedding light on these barriers, recognizing them, and addressing them with consistent dedication, unwavering resilience, and deep consideration of others' feelings is essential for navigating toward effective solutions.

  - **Personal Accountability:** Individuals may respond negatively if they feel personally implicated, often leading to denial or defensive behaviors.
  - **Emotional Responses:** Highlighting issues can trigger personal pain or distress, sometimes resulting in avoidance or invalidation.
  - **Dismissal and Denial:** Issues with low awareness may be ignored due to disbelief, stigma, or a lack of perceived authority in the messenger.
  - **Rationalizations:** Some might acknowledge the issue but find excuses for inaction; others may rationalize it as a weakness, even going so far as to use it as a stepping stone for their own emotional or personal empowerment.



### Personal Commitment and Consent

- **Positive Engagement**: I actively support those I trust and care deeply for, as well as marginalized groups that remain largely invisible. My service is offered discreetly, without the desire for recognition or public acknowledgment. This commitment stems from a strong personal connection to their struggles and a willingness to serve quietly.
- **Consensual Service**: My engagement is characterized by a deep sense of submission to those who earn my trust and respect. I offer my service as a conscious choice, embracing the opportunity to support and enhance the lives of others without seeking visibility. This form of service is not about gaining acknowledgment but about fulfilling a need where it is most deeply felt.
- **Navigating Complex Dynamics**: In managing complex dynamics, I am neither vulnerable nor inexperienced. I choose to contribute silently where I can be most effective, working without credit to benefit those who truly deserve it. This approach is a deliberate, informed decision, allowing me to provide substantial support behind the scenes. For the right individuals or groups, I am fully prepared to extend my service, doing so with the full awareness that my contributions may never be publicly recognized.

## Closing Statements

If you've read this far, you should now have a deeper understanding of awareness and decision-making from one perspective. This includes exploring three different levels of informed decision-making, recognizing four variations of issues that can arise, and understanding the decision-making factors and pitfalls associated with addressing and resolving these issues.

Initially, I stated:
- *I'm not omniscient, my eyes are cloudy.*

I welcome any feedback through direct digital messages or any other form of digital comments on this document. I am open to editing the text, particularly if your insights are high-impact and cost-effective. So many people have contributed to my awareness in general, and as such this text, yet my eyes are still cloudy—show me the light! 👉👈

Thank you!

Finally: When raising awareness, spelling it out with the right words is important. If you don't, it might blow up in your face and you'll get burnt.
